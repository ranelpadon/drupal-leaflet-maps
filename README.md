drupal-leaflet-maps
===================

A Drupal utility module to complement the CKEditor Leaflet Maps
(ckeditor.com/addon/leaflet) plugin installation in Drupal.

Usage:

Download the zipped file of this Drupal Leaflet Maps repo here:
https://github.com/ranelpadon/drupal-leaflet-maps/archive/master.zip

Extract the contents and copy and paste the "leaflet_maps" module folder to your modules folder
depending on your preference or existing modules' configuration:
    sites/all/modules/leaflet_maps
    sites/all/modules/contrib/leaflet_maps
    sites/all/modules/custom/leaflet_maps

Then, enable the module after copying, just like other Drupal modules:
    either manual activation via Drupal modules' admin page in "admin/modules"
    or using Drush: $ drush en -y leaflet_maps.
